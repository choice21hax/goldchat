### Tamper Protection

Tamper Protection is enabled by default.
Get a 21Key Unlocker to turn off TP.
This however does not mean you cant change values of Configs. Protected Files are known by System.
Please respect the Free & Premium versions of this app!

Q: What happens if I tamper with the app (non-config files)?

A: The app goes into a lockdown state and you would have to reinstall (lose your DB), and restart or contact 21Studios support.
